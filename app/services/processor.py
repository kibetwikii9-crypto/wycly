"""Message processor for handling normalized messages.

This module provides intent detection and data preparation. The processor is SILENT:
- It only prepares data (message text, user_id, intent)
- It never contains user-facing text
- It never returns hardcoded messages
- It always delegates response generation to the AI layer

The AI layer (ai.generate_response) is responsible for all text generation.
